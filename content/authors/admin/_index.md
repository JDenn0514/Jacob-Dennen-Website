I am a senior at Denison University studying Political Science. Currently, I am conducting a year-long senior research project with honors on antisemitism among the American Left. Furthermore, I am interested in continuing to research and study antisemitism as I believe that it is essential to understand it in order to fight it.

I am currently a captain on the Denison Men's Tennis Team.
