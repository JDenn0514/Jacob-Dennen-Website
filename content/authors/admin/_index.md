Hi! Welcome to my website! A little about my website. First of all, it is still under maintenance and has not been completed yet but eventually will contain blog posts, projects, and other stuff I find interesting.

About myself, my name is Jacob Dennen and I am a senior at Denison University studying political science. I am currently conducting research on antisemitism among the American Left, particularly Progressives and Liberals. Outside of school, I am on the Denison Men's Tennis Team and I am a die hard Chicago White Sox fan.
